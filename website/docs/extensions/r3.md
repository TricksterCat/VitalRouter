[Cysharp/R3](https://github.com/Cysharp/R3) is a new Rx (Reactive extensions) library that works with Unity and various platforms.

It is the successor to the popular UniRx, with a more modern implementation, a refined API, and an abstraction layer.
Check the R3 documentation for more details.

VitalRouter supports integration with R3.

```cs
Observable<TCommand> o = publisher.AsObservable<TCommand>() // Convert pub/sub to R3 Observable
```

```cs
// Subscibe and bind publisher.
observable
    .Select(x => new FooCommand { X = x }
    .SubscribeToPublish(Router.Default);
    
// Subscibe and bind publisher and await for publishing all. (PublishAsync().Forget())
await observable
    .Select(x => new FooCommand { X = x }
    .ForEachPublishAndForgetAsync(Router.Default);
    
// Subscibe and bind publisher and await for publishing all. (await PublishAsync() one by one)
await observable
    .Select(x => new FooCommand { X = x }
    .ForEachPublishAndAwaitAsync(Router.Default);
```
